= Deploy a Go Microservices Application

Now that you have your environment provisioned and the prerequisites fulfilled, it is time to start working on the labs.

== Application Overview

You will be deploying a ratings application on Azure Red Hat OpenShift.

image::media/app-overview.png[Application diagram,width=100%]

The application consists of 3 components:

|===
| Component | Link

| A public facing API `rating-api`
| https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-api[GitHub repo]

| A public facing web frontend `rating-web`
| https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web[GitHub repo]

| A MongoDB with pre-loaded data
| https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-api/raw/master/data.tar.gz[Data]
|===

Once you're done, you'll have an experience similar to the below.

image:media/app-overview-3.png[Application]

== Create Project

A project allows a community of users to organize and manage their content in isolation from other communities.
A project has a 1-to-1 mapping with a standard Kubernetes namespace.

. Create a project called `workshop`:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc new-project workshop
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
Now using project "workshop" on server "https://api.gqfnl2xz.eastus.aroapp.io:6443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app rails-postgresql-example

to build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.33 -- /agnhost serve-hostname

== Deploy MongoDB from DockerHub image

Azure Red Hat OpenShift allows you to deploy a container image from Docker hub easily and we will deploy a MongoDB database service this way.
The mandatory environment variables (user, password, database name etc.) can be passed in the `oc new-app` command line

. Deploy the MongoDB database:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc new-app bitnami/mongodb \
  -e MONGODB_USERNAME=ratingsuser \
  -e MONGODB_PASSWORD=ratingspassword \
  -e MONGODB_DATABASE=ratingsdb \
  -e MONGODB_ROOT_USER=root \
  -e MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD=ratingspassword
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
--> Found container image f426934 (2 days old) from Docker Hub for "bitnami/mongodb"

    * An image stream tag will be created as "mongodb:latest" that will track this image

--> Creating resources ...
    imagestream.image.openshift.io "mongodb" created
    deployment.apps "mongodb" created
    service "mongodb" created
--> Success
    Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:
     'oc expose service/mongodb'
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
----

. Head back to the OpenShift web console.
+
If you don't see the Developer perspective click on the *Administrator* link under the OpenShift logo and select *Developer*, then if applicable click *Skip Tour* and select your `workshop` project from the *Project* drop down.
. Then click *Topology* to see the application layout.

=== Verify if the mongoDB pod was created successfully

Run the `oc get all` command to view the status of the new application and verify if the deployment of the mongoDB template was successful.

. Display all resources in the `workshop` project:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get all
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----

=== Retrieve mongoDB service hostname

. Find the mongoDB service.
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get svc mongodb
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
NAME      TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)     AGE
mongodb   ClusterIP   172.30.170.239   <none>        27017/TCP   5m20s
----
+
The service will be accessible at the following DNS name: `mongodb.workshop.svc.cluster.local` which is formed of `[service name].[project name].svc.cluster.local`.
This resolves only within the cluster.

. You can also retrieve this from the web console (click on the *mongodb* deployment, then under *Services* click on the *mongodb* service). You'll need this hostname to configure the `rating-api`.

image::media/mongo-svc-webconsole.png[MongoDB service in the Web Console]

== Deploy Ratings API

The `rating-api` is a NodeJS application that connects to mongoDB to retrieve and rate items.
Below are some of the details that you'll need to deploy this.

* `rating-api` on GitHub: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-api
* The container exposes port 8080
* MongoDB connection is configured using an environment variable called `MONGODB_URI`
* You're going to be using <<source-to-image-s2i,source-to-image (S2I)>> as a build strategy.

. Create the new application from git source
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc new-app https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-api --strategy=source --name=rating-api
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
--> Found image 3e4c7d3 (2 weeks old) in image stream "openshift/nodejs" under tag "16-ubi8" for "nodejs"

    Node.js 16
    ----------
    Node.js 16 available as container is a base platform for building and running various Node.js 16 applications and frameworks. Node.js is a p
latform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking
 I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

    Tags: builder, nodejs, nodejs16

    * The source repository appears to match: nodejs
    * A source build using source code from https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-api will be created
      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream tag "rating-api:latest"
      * Use 'oc start-build' to trigger a new build

--> Creating resources ...
    imagestream.image.openshift.io "rating-api" created
    buildconfig.build.openshift.io "rating-api" created
    deployment.apps "rating-api" created
    service "rating-api" created
--> Success
    Build scheduled, use 'oc logs -f buildconfig/rating-api' to track its progress.
    Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:
     'oc expose service/rating-api'
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
----

=== Configure the required environment variables

Create the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable.

This URI should look like `mongodb://[username]:[password]@[endpoint]:27017/ratingsdb`.
You'll need to replace the `[username]` and `[password]` with the ones you used when creating the database.
You'll also need to replace the `[endpoint]` with the hostname acquired in the previous step

. Set the environment variable for the `Deployment` called *rating-api*:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc set env deploy/rating-api MONGODB_URI=mongodb://ratingsuser:ratingspassword@mongodb.workshop.svc.cluster.local:27017/ratingsdb
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
deployment.apps/rating-api updated
----

=== Verify that the service is running

If you check the logs of and pod managed by the `rating-api` deployment, you should see a log message confirming the code can successfully connect to the mongoDB.

. Check that your pods have a log message confirming that the application can connect to the database:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc logs deploy/rating-api | grep CONNECTED
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
'CONNECTED TO mongodb://ratingsuser:ratingspassword@mongodb.workshop.svc.cluster.local:27017/ratingsdb'
----

=== Retrieve `rating-api` service hostname

. Find the `rating-api` service.
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get svc rating-api
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
rating-api   ClusterIP   172.30.58.112   <none>        8080/TCP   8m58s
----

The service will be accessible at the following DNS name over port 8080: `rating-api.workshop.svc.cluster.local:8080` which is formed of `[service name].[project name].svc.cluster.local`. This resolves only within the cluster.


== Deploy Ratings frontend

The `rating-web` is a NodeJS application that connects to the `rating-api`.
Below are some of the details that you'll need to deploy this.

* `rating-web` on GitHub: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web
* The rating-web frontend Dockerfile needs modification to the image to run on ARO 4.x versions
* The container exposes port 8080
* The web app connects to the API over the internal cluster DNS, using a proxy through an environment variable named `API`

=== Fork the application to your own GitHub repository

To be able to setup CI/CD webhooks, you'll need to fork the application into your personal GitHub repository.

https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web/fork[Fork]

=== Modify Dockerfile in your repository

The build will take between 5-10 minutes

image::media/oc-newapp-ratingweb.png[Create rating-web using oc cli]

{% endcollapsible %}

=== Configure the required environment variables

{% collapsible %}

Create the `API` environment variable for `rating-web` Deployment Config.
The value of this variable is going to be the hostname/port of the `rating-api` service.

Instead of setting the environment variable through the Azure Red Hat OpenShift Web Console, you can set it through the OpenShift CLI.

[,sh]
----
oc set env deploy rating-web API=http://rating-api:8080
----

{% endcollapsible %}

=== Expose the `rating-web` service using a Route

{% collapsible %}

Expose the service.

[,sh]
----
oc expose svc/rating-web
----

Find out the created route hostname

[,sh]
----
oc get route rating-web
----

You should get a response similar to the below.

image::media/oc-get-route.png[Retrieve the created route]

Notice the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is comprised of the application name and project name by default.
The remainder of the FQDN, the subdomain, is your Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster specific apps subdomain.

{% endcollapsible %}

=== Try the service

{% collapsible %}

Open the hostname in your browser, you should see the rating app page.
Play around, submit a few votes and check the leaderboard.

image::media/rating-web-homepage.png[rating-web homepage]
