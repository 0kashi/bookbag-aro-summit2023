= Deploy a Go Microservices Application

Now that you have your environment provisioned and the prerequisites fulfilled, it is time to start working on the labs.

== Application Overview

You will be deploying a ratings application on Azure Red Hat OpenShift.

image::media/app-overview.png[Application diagram,width=100%]

The application consists of 3 components:

|===
| Component | Link

| A public facing API `rating-api`
| https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-api[GitHub repo]

| A public facing web frontend `rating-web`
| https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web[GitHub repo]

| A MongoDB with pre-loaded data
| https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-api/raw/master/data.tar.gz[Data]
|===

Once you're done, you'll have an experience similar to the below.

== Create Project

=== Create a project

A project allows a community of users to organize and manage their content in isolation from other communities.
A project has a 1-to-1 mapping with a standard Kubernetes namespace.

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc new-project workshop
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
Now using project "workshop" on server "https://api.gqfnl2xz.eastus.aroapp.io:6443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app rails-postgresql-example

to build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.33 -- /agnhost serve-hostname

== Deploy MongoDB

=== Create mongoDB from Docker hub

Azure Red Hat OpenShift allows you to deploy a container image from Docker hub easily and we will deploy a MongoDB database service this way.
The mandatory environment variables (user, password, database name etc.) can be passed in the `oc new-app` command line

Deploy the MongoDB database (you can safely ignore the warning about not having `git` available):

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc new-app bitnami/mongodb \
  -e MONGODB_USERNAME=ratingsuser \
  -e MONGODB_PASSWORD=ratingspassword \
  -e MONGODB_DATABASE=ratingsdb \
  -e MONGODB_ROOT_USER=root \
  -e MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD=ratingspassword
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
warning: Cannot find git. Ensure that it is installed and in your path. Git is required to work with git repositories.
--> Found container image f426934 (2 days old) from Docker Hub for "bitnami/mongodb"

    * An image stream tag will be created as "mongodb:latest" that will track this image

--> Creating resources ...
    imagestream.image.openshift.io "mongodb" created
    deployment.apps "mongodb" created
    service "mongodb" created
--> Success
    Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:
     'oc expose service/mongodb'
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
----

. Head back to the OpenShift web console.
+
If you don't see the Developer perspective click on the *Administrator* link under the OpenShift logo and select *Developer*, then if applicable click *Skip Tour* and select your `workshop` project from the *Project* drop down.
. Then click *Topology* to see the application layout.

image::media/mongodb-overview.png[MongoDB deployment]

=== Verify if the mongoDB pod was created successfully

Run the `oc get all` command to view the status of the new application and verify if the deployment of the mongoDB template was successful.

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get all
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----

=== Retrieve mongoDB service hostname

. Find the mongoDB service.
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc get svc mongodb
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
NAME      TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)     AGE
mongodb   ClusterIP   172.30.170.239   <none>        27017/TCP   5m20s
----
+
The service will be accessible at the following DNS name: `mongodb.workshop.svc.cluster.local` which is formed of `[service name].[project name].svc.cluster.local`.
This resolves only within the cluster.

. You can also retrieve this from the web console (click on the *mongodb* deployment, then under *Services* click on the *mongodb* service). You'll need this hostname to configure the `rating-api`.

image::media/mongo-svc-webconsole.png[MongoDB service in the Web Console]

== Deploy Ratings API

The `rating-api` is a NodeJS application that connects to mongoDB to retrieve and rate items.
Below are some of the details that you'll need to deploy this.

* `rating-api` on GitHub: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-api
* The container exposes port 8080
* MongoDB connection is configured using an environment variable called `MONGODB_URI`

=== Use the OpenShift CLI to deploy the `rating-api`

____
*Note* You're going to be using <<source-to-image-s2i,source-to-image (S2I)>> as a build strategy.
____

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc new-app https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-api --strategy=source --name=rating-api
----


=== Configure the required environment variables

Create the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable.
This URI should look like `mongodb://[username]:[password]@[endpoint]:27017/ratingsdb`.
You'll need to replace the `[usernaame]` and `[password]` with the ones you used when creating the database.
You'll also need to replace the `[endpoint]` with the hostname acquired in the previous step

Hit *Save* when done.

image::media/rating-api-envvars.png[Create a MONGODB_URI environment variable]

It can also be done with CLI

----
oc set env deploy/rating-api MONGODB_URI=mongodb://ratingsuser:ratingspassword@mongodb.workshop.svc.cluster.local:27017/ratingsdb
----

=== Verify that the service is running

If you navigate to the logs of the `rating-api` deployment, you should see a log message confirming the code can successfully connect to the mongoDB.
For that, in the deployment's details screen, click on _Pods_ tab, then on one of the pods

image::media/rating-api-working.png[Verify mongoDB connection]

=== Retrieve `rating-api` service hostname

Find the `rating-api` service.

[,sh]
----
oc get svc rating-api
----

The service will be accessible at the following DNS name over port 8080: `rating-api.workshop.svc.cluster.local:8080` which is formed of `[service name].[project name].svc.cluster.local`.
This resolves only within the cluster.


== Deploy Ratings frontend

The `rating-web` is a NodeJS application that connects to the `rating-api`.
Below are some of the details that you'll need to deploy this.

* `rating-web` on GitHub: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web
* The rating-web frontend Dockerfile needs modification to the image to run on ARO 4.x versions
* The container exposes port 8080
* The web app connects to the API over the internal cluster DNS, using a proxy through an environment variable named `API`

=== Fork the application to your own GitHub repository

To be able to setup CI/CD webhooks, you'll need to fork the application into your personal GitHub repository.

https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web/fork[Fork]

=== Modify Dockerfile in your repository

____
*Note* The Dockerfile needs to be modified to use the correct node.js image to build correctly.
____

____
*Note* The `git` commands shown below have been run in a local shell pre-authenticated against the GitHub repository
____

. Clone the Git repository locally and change to repo directory

[,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/<your GitHub username>/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web.git
cd mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web
----

{% endcollapsible %}

=== Use the OpenShift CLI to deploy the `rating-web`

____
*Note* You're going to be using <<source-to-image-s2i,source-to-image (S2I)>> as a build strategy.
____

{% collapsible %}

[,sh]
----
oc new-app https://github.com/<your GitHub username>/mslearn-aks-workshop-ratings-web --strategy=docker --name=rating-web
----

The build will take between 5-10 minutes

image::media/oc-newapp-ratingweb.png[Create rating-web using oc cli]

{% endcollapsible %}

=== Configure the required environment variables

{% collapsible %}

Create the `API` environment variable for `rating-web` Deployment Config.
The value of this variable is going to be the hostname/port of the `rating-api` service.

Instead of setting the environment variable through the Azure Red Hat OpenShift Web Console, you can set it through the OpenShift CLI.

[,sh]
----
oc set env deploy rating-web API=http://rating-api:8080
----

{% endcollapsible %}

=== Expose the `rating-web` service using a Route

{% collapsible %}

Expose the service.

[,sh]
----
oc expose svc/rating-web
----

Find out the created route hostname

[,sh]
----
oc get route rating-web
----

You should get a response similar to the below.

image::media/oc-get-route.png[Retrieve the created route]

Notice the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is comprised of the application name and project name by default.
The remainder of the FQDN, the subdomain, is your Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster specific apps subdomain.

{% endcollapsible %}

=== Try the service

{% collapsible %}

Open the hostname in your browser, you should see the rating app page.
Play around, submit a few votes and check the leaderboard.

image::media/rating-web-homepage.png[rating-web homepage]

{% endcollapsible %}

=== Setup GitHub webhook

To trigger S2I builds when you push code into your GitHib repo, you'll need to setup the GitHub webhook.

{% collapsible %}

Retrieve the GitHub webhook trigger secret.
You'll need use this secret in the GitHub webhook URL.

[,sh]
----
oc get bc/rating-web -o=jsonpath='{.spec.triggers..github.secret}'
----

You'll get back something similar to the below.
Make note the secret key in the red box as you'll need it in a few steps.

image::media/rating-web-github-secret.png[Rating Web GitHub trigger secret]

Retrieve the GitHub webhook trigger URL from the build configuration.

[,sh]
----
oc describe bc/rating-web
----

image::media/rating-web-github-webhook-url.png[Rating Web GitHub trigger url]

Replace the `<secret>` placeholder with the secret you retrieved in the previous step to have a URL similar to `+https://api.otyvsnz3.eastus.aroapp.io:6443/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/workshop/buildconfigs/rating-web/webhooks/SECRETSTRING/github+`.
You'll use this URL to setup the webhook on your GitHub repository.

In your GitHub repository, select *Add Webhook* from *Settings* → *Webhooks*.

Paste the URL output (similar to above) into the Payload URL field.

Change the Content Type from GitHub's default *application/x-www-form-urlencoded* to *application/json*.

Click *Add webhook*.

image::media/rating-web-github-addwebhook.png[GitHub add webhook]

You should see a message from GitHub stating that your webhook was successfully configured.

Now, whenever you push a change to your GitHub repository, a new build will automatically start, and upon a successful build a new deployment will start.

{% endcollapsible %}

=== Make a change to the website app and see the rolling update

{% collapsible %}

Go to the `+https://github.com/<your GitHub username>/rating-web/blob/master/src/App.vue+` file in your repository on GitHub.

Edit the file, and change the `background-color: #999;` line to be `background-color: #0071c5`.

Commit the changes to the file into the `master` branch.

image::media/rating-web-editcolor.png[GitHub edit app]

Immediately, go to the *Builds* tab in the OpenShift Web Console.
You'll see a new build queued up which was triggered by the push.
Once this is done, it will trigger a new deployment and you should see the new website color updated.
